        <p>Hey, I'm Stepan and I build software.</p>

        <p>I spent half of my life in Czechia üçª and the other half in Australia ü¶ò.</p>

        <p>
          I've been writing code for... a while. I worked for dozens of companies of all sizes as an IT contractor /
          consultant. Contracting life was great but I wanted to create my own product. I didn't quite succeed with
          Hero.work, a job matcher for tradespeople... but then I co-founded a <a
            href="https://www.budgetly.com.au"
            target="_blank">B2B fintech called Budgetly</a
          > which is doing very well. I left my CTO chair at the end of 2023 to pursue other challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about startups - ideas, execution, mentoring, investing. As well I often think about other
          things than programming - like mountain bikes, future of the human race or optimising public transport ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
